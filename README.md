MICROCONTROLLER LAB USING C AND ASSEMBLY:

LAB 1: Introduction to Microcontroller programming using PIC microcontroller / Tutorial

- Part 1: Created C program to blink four LEDs at different rates depending on the voltage V_Var supplied by the potentiometer to the pin RA0. The lower the voltage, the faster the LEDs will blink.
- Part 2: Utilized the UART to USB translator chip designed to connect a serial port to a USB port on your laptop. Linked Peripheral Library onto the project. LED on board will continuously blink to visually show good serial communication. Used TeraTerm to output C code onto the terminal using UART. 
- Part 3: Tested A/D channels. Potentiometer changes the value of AN0, AN1, AN2, and AN4 voltages, but all four should be around the same. Voltage on AN3 should remove a constant value of about 4.096V. Outputs should also show on TeraTerm terminal using UART. 

LAB 2: Input / Output Control using C Language

- Part 1: Wrote a C program that will input from a bank of a 4 switch DIP and output each input to a corresponding LED with the PIC18F. We used PORTA as an input and PORTB as an output and the Analog to Digital Converter (ADCON1).
- Part 2: Added an additional output, PORTC, for our RGB LED. Used 3 inputs from the DIP Switch to turn on a specific RGB color on the LED. 
- Part 3: Wrote an endless loop that will cycle through all 8 colors (000-->111) of the RGB LED with a one second delay.
- Part 4: Used the code for part 3 and added another RGB LED to show the inverse color or bits within the endless loop. 
- Part 5: Used arrays to write specific values for the three RGB LEDs and call them inside an endless for loop. 

LAB 3: Introduction to Assembly Program

  - Part 1: Learned the basic functions of assembly programming by alternating between 2 pairs of flashing LEDs.
  - Part 2: Rewrote the code for Lab 2 part 1 in assembly that used a dip switch to control the output of the LEDs.
  - Part 3: Rewrote the code for Lab 2 part 2 in assembly that used a dip switch to control the output of an RGB LED.
  - Part 4: Rewrote the code for Lab 2 part 3 in assembly that used a forever for loop to cycle through the binary coded colors of an RBG LED with a one second delay. Used branching and decrementing and incrementing values.
  - Part 5: Rewrote the code for Lab 2 part 5 in assembly that used for an array and a forever for loop to cycle through specific colors of 3 RBG LEDs with a one second delay. Used LFSR0 as a pointer to the values given in the array and their memory locations, then POSTINC0 to point to the next address. 

LAB 4: Assembly Program

  - Part A: Wrote an assembly program that did 1's Complement for PORTA (4 bits) and output it to PORTD.
  - Part B: Added an LED indicating the Zero Flag using the BZ instruction.
  - Part C: Added (ADDWF) two inputs together and displayed it on PORTD while using the Zero Flag.
  - Part D: Replaced ADDWF with ANDWF and displayed it on PORTD while using the Zero Flag.
  - Part E: Replaced with XORWF while using the Zero Flag.
  - Part F: Converted the binary input of PORTA to its BCD equivalent while using the Zero Flag.
  - Part G: Added all the previous tasks into their designated subroutines. Indicated which task to do based off another 3 input Dip Switch (000-100). Depending on the input, it will change the procedure. Utilized subroutines, BTFSC, and practiced proper jumping/branching techniques.
