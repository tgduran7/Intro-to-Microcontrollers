MICROCONTROLLER LAB USING C AND ASSEMBLY:

LAB 1: Introduction to Microcontroller programming using PIC microcontroller / Tutorial

- Part 1: Created C program to blink four LEDs at different rates depending on the voltage V_Var supplied by the potentiometer to the pin RA0. The lower the voltage, the faster the LEDs will blink.
- Part 2: Utilized the UART to USB translator chip designed to connect a serial port to a USB port on your laptop. Linked Peripheral Library onto the project. LED on board will continuously blink to visually show good serial communication. Used TeraTerm to output C code onto the terminal using UART. 
- Part 3: Tested A/D channels. Potentiometer changes the value of AN0, AN1, AN2, and AN4 voltages, but all four should be around the same. Voltage on AN3 should remove a constant value of about 4.096V. Outputs should also show on TeraTerm terminal using UART.
